Day 12 : 8 July, 11:41 PM
1. Continued with Lesson 9 - Encrypted deep learning. Completed lectures till "Project Demo - Build an Encrypted Database"
2. Studied about web sockets w.r.t the PySyft websocket federated learning implementation

Day 11 : 7 July, 8:57 PM
1. Started with Lesson 9 - Encrypted deep learning
2. Joined the study group "INTRO (AI Challenge Study Group)"
3. Studied the PySyft WebSocket federated learning example https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/tree/dev/examples/tutorials/advanced/websockets-example-MNIST

Day 10 : 6 July, 11:16 PM
1. Completed Lesson  6 - "Differential privacy for deep learning". Implemented final project for this lesson to train a model on a dummy public unlabelled image dataset using private labels as per the hospital example given in this lesson. Code uploaded on my github account https://github.com/amit-rastogi/60DaysofUdacity/blob/master/DifferentialPrivacyForDeepLearning/FinalProject_DifferentialPrivacyForDeepLearning.ipynb
2. Worked on my PySyft PR https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/pull/2339
3. Today I would like to encourage @Arka and @Droid

Day 9 : 5 July, 9:36 PM
1. Continued with Lesson  6 - "Differential privacy for deep learning"
2. Worked on an OpenMined PySyft issue https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/issues/2333

The below updates have been taken from my twitter account (Handle - @amitrastogi2202) since slack couldn't show updates before Day 9 in its search results. 

Day 8 : 4 July 
1. Continued with Lesson  6 - "Differential privacy for deep learning". Specifically completed chapters 6.3 (generating differentially private labels for dataset) and 6.4 (PATE analysis)
2. Worked on adding version attribute to syft so that PySyft users could use syft.__version__ to retrieve the version of PySyft they are using. Created a PR for the same https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/pull/2335

Day 7 : 3 July
1. Started with Lesson 6 - Differential privacy for deep learning.
2. Studied about pytorch autograd and debugged some code using basic operations on autograd enabled tensors to understand autograd

Day 6 : 2 July
Completed lesson 5 "Introducing Local and Global Differential Privacy". Implemented the project demo to create a global differentially private query using laplacian noise. Code uploaded on github. https://github.com/amit-rastogi/60DaysofUdacity/blob/master/DifferentialPrivacy/GlobalDifferentialPrivacy.ipynb

Day 5: 1 July
Continued lesson 5 "Introducing Local and Global Differential Privacy" Covered how to vary amount of noise to be added for local differential privacy and de-skew results accordingly. Updated code on github. https://github.com/amit-rastogi/60DaysofUdacity/blob/master/DifferentialPrivacy/LocalDifferentialPrivacy.ipynb

Day 4: 30 June
Completed lesson 4 "Evaluating the privacy of a function". Started lesson 5 "Introducing Local and Global Differential Privacy". Implemented project demo for local differential privacy and uploaded on github. https://github.com/amit-rastogi/60DaysofUdacity/blob/master/DifferentialPrivacy/LocalDifferentialPrivacy.ipynb

Day 3: 29 June
Completed project demo for Lesson 8.2. Implemented a fully connected 2 layer binary classifier on a toy dataset using federated learning and a trusted model aggregator. Code uploaded on github. https://github.com/amit-rastogi/60DaysofUdacity/blob/master/SecuringFederatedLearning/FederatedLearningWithTrustedAggregrator.ipynb

Day 2: 28 June
Completed lesson 3 "Introducing differential privacy". Started lesson 4 "Evaluating the privacy of a function". Uploaded sample code for empirical calculation of sensitivity of sum & mean query on https://github.com/amit-rastogi/60DaysofUdacity

Day 1: 27 June
Took the pledge for the #60DaysofUdacity challenge starting today.
Started with the OpenMined Grid project. Did the code setup on my machine and debugged the tutorial code.
